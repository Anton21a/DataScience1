## Reproducibility Report
I was able to clone the repository without any problems.  
Setting up the environment with `project_environment.yml` worked smoothly, although it took a bit of time because it installs quite a few packages.  
After activating the environment (`conda activate data-analysis`), I ran `bash run_script.sh`, and everything executed correctly.  
I didn’t have to change any lines of code, which is great! The setup seems well-configured and reproducible right out of the box.

## Overall Opinion
I really liked how clean and well-organized this project is. It’s clear you put effort into making it easy to follow and run smoothly. My opinion from this aspect is:  
- **Reproducibility:** Excellent — everything ran as expected.  
- **Documentation:** Clear and easy to understand.  
- **Coding style:** Neat, consistent, and well-structured.  
- **Use of Git:** Commits are organized and the repo is tidy.  
- **Overall impression:** Feels professional and well thought out — great job!  

## Suggested Improvements
- You could mention where the results or generated files are saved, so users know what to look for after running the script.  
- Since the environment file is quite heavy, maybe include a lighter alternative (for example a minimal `requirements.txt`) for quick testing.
